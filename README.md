### Support Ticket Classifier using text classifier (Naive bayes) in Machine Learning

This project deals with classifiying support ticket senario/issue in the form of text into category.
As there are diffrent support senario if one need to know under which category this issue belongs, this model would help us to identify it.

Steps Involved:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Pre-Porcessing (Data Balancing)
3. Exploratary Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Selection
5. Train-Test Split
6. Count vertorizer - Convert a collection of text documents to a martix of token counts
7. Tfidf- Term-frequency inverse document frequency. How frequently a term occurs in document 
8. Model Creation ( Naive bayes Classifier )
9. Score ( Measures the accuracy of the model against the training data)
10.Predicting Output

Result Accuracy- 94.2
